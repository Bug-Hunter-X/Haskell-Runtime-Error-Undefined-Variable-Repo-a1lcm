This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Haskell caused by using the `undefined` value. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version.  Understanding how `undefined` works is crucial to avoiding this type of error.  The solution shows how to handle potential undefined values using pattern matching or the Maybe monad.
